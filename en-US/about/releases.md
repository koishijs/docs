# Updates

## Release Cycle

Koishi currently adopts the Cordis architecture, with the majority of its functionalities provided in the form of plugins. These plugins are updated as needed and all follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/lang/zh-CN/) guidelines:

- Patch versions are only used for bug fixes and do not introduce new features.
- Minor versions may include new features but will not break existing functionalities.
- Major versions introduce breaking changes.

In the context of semantic versioning, all definitions of expected behavior are based on the official Koishi documentation.

Koishi's updates are released approximately every 1-2 weeks. These versions are classified as either patch or minor versions based on Koishi's own dependencies. The current major version of Koishi is v4, and there are no plans to change the major version at this time.

For upgrades from lower versions of v4, you can refer to this [Migration Guide](./upgrade.md).
