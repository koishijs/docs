# Introduction

Koishi is a cross-platform, extensive, high-performance chatbot framework.

The name and icon design are inspired from [Komeiji Koishi](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Koishi_Komeiji), who is a character in Touhou Project. Komeiji Koishi manipulates the unconscious, which symbolizes the theme of a chatbot as well as the love of the Koishi developers for it.
